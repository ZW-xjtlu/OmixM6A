# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install OmixM6A from GitHub
devtools::install_github("your_github_username/OmixM6A")
```

## Overview

OmixM6A provides:

- **Advanced Statistical Models**: Fit a range of models, including zero-inflated beta-binomial mixtures, beta-binomial mixtures, binomial mixtures, and binomial-uniform mixtures, to m6A count data.
- **Flexible Data Handling**: Efficiently analyze both individual count vectors and complex `SummarizedExperiment` objects, allowing for versatile data analysis workflows.
- **Robust Classification and Normalization**: Accurately classify and normalize m6A methylation states, calculating posterior probabilities, p-values, and false discovery rates (FDR).
- **High-Level Visualization**: Generate visualizations to compare model fits, assess goodness of fit, and interpret the results of different statistical models.
- **Scalability**: Designed for large-scale m6A datasets, ensuring efficient processing and analysis for epitranscriptome research.

## Key Features

- **Posterior Probability Calculation**: Accurately estimate the posterior probabilities of m6A modification states across biological samples.
- **P-Value and FDR Calculation**: Generate p-values and false discovery rates to assess the statistical significance of m6A sites.
- **Model Comparison and Visualization**: Visual tools to compare and evaluate the fit of various statistical models, enhancing interpretability and decision-making.
- **Versatile Data Processing**: Handle both simple data structures and complex multi-sample datasets within `SummarizedExperiment` objects, making the package adaptable to different research needs.
